# stuff to do (probably)

* add a "remove user" bit to the admin panel

* some way of locking a session down so no new users can join?
   * maybe just temporarily disable all other users in .htpasswd? 
   * or make a new htpasswd with just the current users and swap back when not on lockdown?

* add the list of plaintext logins (for reminders) somewhere as part of the project, not external as now
