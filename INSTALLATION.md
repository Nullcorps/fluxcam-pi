I'll try to write this going from a blank Buster install on (in this case) a pi zero-w. It's running on a PI3 currently but I'm curious to see whether it'll run on the zero too.

The board strokes (I'll fill these in along the way):

# 1) install the OS 

# 2) set a fixed IP

# 3) install LAMP

# 4) install RPi-Cam-Web-Interface

# 5) install fluxcam-pi

# 6) do a bit of local configuring

# 7) set up firewall/external access

# 8) get a free SSL cert from LetsEncrypt

# 9) set up cloudflare's free tier as a proxy/obfuscation layer

# 10) enjoy private camming :)


(obvs these need filling in which I'll get to as soon as I can)
